👋 About Me

I am a Java Backend Developer with 4+ years of industry experience, currently working at an Indian MNC.
My primary focus is on building scalable, reliable, and maintainable backend systems using the Java & Spring Boot ecosystem.

I strongly believe in clean architecture, clear abstractions, and thoughtful problem-solving over unnecessary complexity.
